                  <p class="card-text">An entire book that is written in the perspective of Death is certain to keep your attention. “The Book Thief” was also the type of book that was just loaded knowledge and lessons to learn. Zusak constantly had readers look through different perspectives which allowed them to learn twice the information. Whenever a book has so much to offer like that, I tend to really find a love for it. But “The Book Thief” is really unique, and I have decided it made my top ten list of favorite books.</p>

He treats her badly, but eventually they have children together and the young mom and children get away from the abusive environment, to make a better life for themselves.  I really like books that show people getting themselves out of hardships because that is always something you can learn from others. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">"Life of Pi" is a book about hardships too, although the hardships faced by the protagonist are very different than most people.  One of the reasons include the fact that his family owns a zoo, and they have to transport all of the animals by boat.  They run into a storm and have to go through a lot of things just to survive.  The things they face include hunger, wild animal fights, and murder.  But the ending of the story allows you to be able to decide what actually happened, which is unique and why I liked it so much.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" is a coming-of-age novel that I had to read the summer before my eighth grade year.  It is a novel I wished I waited to read until I was older to fully understand the things that happened.  But when I read it, I still got a lot out of it.  It had a lot of lessons and was, yet another story, about a young girl getting out of a tough situation, but looking back on it to see how it shaped her into a better human being.  These are stories that help me learn a thing or two or ten about life, to make me into a better human being.

This story is also written from the perspective of a boy who is on the spectrum.  He has Asperger's Syndrome, where he pays a lot of attention to details, which is sometimes his downfall.  But at the same time, it is his personality and he is a fantastic human being.  He cares a lot about a dog in his neighborhood, that died, and he wants to figure out how it happened.  While he does, he leads the readers on a wild adventure, making it difficult to ever stop reading as well.</p>
